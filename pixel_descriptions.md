This file gives a brief description of each of the ten pixels used in the RSS SMAP V5 L2C science-grade examples.
Each pixel number in this file corresponds to the number (`##`) in the input L2B and output L2C file names
(i.e., `sample_l2b_38362_##.txt` and `sample_l2c_38362_##_output_rss.txt`).  For this exercise, a variety of pixels were chosen
in order to illustrate how the algorithm performs in varying environmental conditions.

For each pixel listed below, the pixel latitude, longitude, and a brief description are given.  Note that all pixels
are from SMAP orbit `38362`, which occurred in early April 2022.

- Pixel 1: -35.880, 66.868.  In the Southern Ocean near Madagascar.  Open ocean pixel.
- Pixel 2:  75.130, 25.410.  Between Northern Scandinavia and Svalbard.  Sea-ice zone = 2.
- Pixel 3:  16.409, 229.504. Eastern Pacific between Mexico and Hawaii.  Open ocean pixel.
- Pixel 4:   9.357, 55.377.  Arabian Sea.  East of the Horn of Africa.  Open ocean pixel.
- Pixel 5:  16.364, 53.114.  Just South of Saudi Arabia. gland ~ 0.07.  Land contaminated pixel.
- Pixel 6:  79.627,  7.258.  West of Svalbard.  Sea-ice zone = 3.
- Pixel 7:  68.392, 13.214.  Off the West coast of Norway.  gland ~0.08.  Land contaminated pixel.
- Pixel 8:  13.121, 228.115. Eastern Pacific between Mexico and Hawaii.  Slightly South of pixel 3.  Open ocean pixel.
- Pixel 9:  47.377, 226.874. West of the Olympic Peninnsula.  Rain-contaminated, open ocean pixel.
- Pixel 10:  9.868, 55.626.  Similar location to Pixel 4.  Open ocean pixel.
