This file gives a brief description of each of the ten pixels used in the RSS SMAP V5 L2C science-grade examples.
Each pixel number in this file corresponds to the number (`##`) in the input L2B and output L2C file names
(i.e., `sample_l2b_38362_##.txt` and `sample_l2c_38362_##_output_rss.txt`).  For this exercise, a variety of pixels were chosen
in order to illustrate how the algorithm performs in varying environmental conditions.

For each pixel listed below, the pixel latitude, longitude, and a brief description are given.  Note that all pixels
are from SMAP orbit `38362`, which occurred in early April 2022.
